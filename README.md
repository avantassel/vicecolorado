Description:
DeVice is an app which provides critical guidance to participants and tourists interested in the
craft industries of colorado. Such as Craft Brewing, Craft Coffee roasters and retailers, Small
Batch Distilleries and recreational Marijuana stores.
The presumption here is that participants and connoisseurs in these areas need critical
guidance for the best experience.
In some cases the best experience is to find a coffee shop open before 7am, in another it’s to
identify the times and tour offerings at the Leopold Brothers distillery. To participate fully and to
have the best experience in Colorado's craft industries a person may want to be well informed to
the benefits and responsibilities unique to the state of Colorado.
Colorado does not currently have any restriction on the amount of coffee intake for any
individual, whether or not they are operating a motor vehicle or bicycle.
However if a person wants to enjoy craft beer, craft spirits or one of Colorado’s elegant strains
of marijuana. Guests to the state and even some of the residents may be unclear about the
unique conditions required to participate safely.
A primary goal here is to have as many participants enjoy Colorado’s safely and inside the
boundaries of the law, where ever they are in the state.
